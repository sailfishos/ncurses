  <title>Ncurses support utilities</title>
  <description>The curses library routines are a terminal-independent method of
updating character screens with reasonable optimization.  The ncurses
(new curses) library is a freely distributable replacement for the
discontinued 4.4 BSD classic curses library.

This package contains support utilities, including a terminfo compiler
tic, a decompiler infocmp, clear, tput, tset, and a termcap conversion
tool captoinfo.
